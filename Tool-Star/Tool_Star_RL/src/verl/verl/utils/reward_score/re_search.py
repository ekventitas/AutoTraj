Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Given Equations:**\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10}(\\sin x) + \\log_{10}(\\cos x) = -1\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of logarithms, we can combine the logs:\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10}(\\sin x \\cos x) = -1 \\implies \\sin x \\cos x = 10^{-1} = \\frac{1}{10}\n   \\]\n   Recall the double-angle identity for sine: \\(\\sin(2x) = 2 \\sin x \\cos x\\). So,\n   \\[\n   \\sin(2x) = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Given Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10}(\\sin x + \\cos x) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\log_{10}(n) - 1)\n   \\]\n   We can rewrite the right-hand side using properties of logarithms:\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10}(\\sin x + \\cos x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log_{10}(n) - \\frac{1}{2} = \\log_{10}(n^{1\/2}) - \\log_{10}(10^{1\/2}) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{10}}\\right)\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\sin x + \\cos x = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{10}}\n   \\]\n   Squaring both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   (\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 = \\frac{n}{10}\n   \\]\n   Expanding the left side:\n   \\[\n   \\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x + 2 \\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{n}{10}\n   \\]\n   Using the Pythagorean identity \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\) and the earlier result \\(\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{1}{10}\\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\frac{n}{10} \\implies 1 + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{n}{10} \\implies \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{n}{10} \\implies n = 12\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this with Python code to ensure the result is accurate.\n </think><code>\nimport math\r\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, log, sin, cos\r\n\r\n# Define the variable\r\nx = symbols('x')\r\n\r\n# First equation: log10(sin(x)) + log10(cos(x)) = -1\r\neq1 = Eq(log(sin(x), 10) + log(cos(x), 10), -1)\r\n\r\n# Solve for sin(x) * cos(x)\r\nsin_x_cos_x = solve(eq1, sin(x) * cos(x))[0]\r\nsin_x_cos_x = sin_x_cos_x.simplify()\r\n\r\n# We know sin(x) * cos(x) = 1\/10\r\nsin_x_cos_x_value = 1 \/ 10\r\n\r\n# Second equation: log10(sin(x) + cos(x)) = 1\/2 * (log10(n) - 1)\r\nn = symbols('n')\r\neq2 = Eq(log(sin(x) + cos(x), 10), (1\/2) * (log(n, 10) - 1))\r\n\r\n# We know (sin(x) + cos(x))^2 = 1 + 2 * sin(x) * cos(x) = 1 + 2 * (1\/10) = 6\/5\r\nsin_x_plus_cos_x_squared = 6 \/ 5\r\nsin_x_plus_cos_x = math.sqrt(sin_x_plus_cos_x_squared)\r\n\r\n# Substitute sin(x) + cos(x) into the second equation\r\nlhs = log(sin_x_plus_cos_x, 10)\r\nrhs = (1\/2) * (log(n, 10) - 1)\r\n\r\n# Solve for n\r\nn_value = solve(Eq(lhs, rhs), n)[0]\r\nprint(n_value)\n</code><result>\n\n12.0000000000000\n</result><search> query </search> query <result> result </result> <answer>The value of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).

How many dogs does Derek have now if he had 90 dogs when he was six years old?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dogs Derek has now. We know that when Derek was 6 years old, he had three times as many dogs as cars. We also know that 10 years later, the number of cars became twice the number of dogs after he sold some of his dogs and bought 210 more cars. We are given that Derek had 90 dogs when he was 6 years old.\n\nFirst, let's establish the initial number of cars and dogs when Derek was 6 years old. If Derek had 90 dogs, and he had three times as many dogs as cars, then the number of cars is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cars} = \\frac{90}{3} = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of dogs and cars 10 years later. Let \\( x \\) be the number of dogs Derek sold. The number of dogs after selling \\( x \\) dogs and buying 210 more cars is:\n\\[ 90 - x + 210 \\]\n\nThe number of cars after buying 210 more cars is:\n\\[ 30 + 210 = 240 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of cars is twice the number of dogs 10 years later:\n\\[ 240 = 2(90 - x + 210) \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 240 = 2(300 - x) \\]\n\\[ 240 = 600 - 2x \\]\n\\[ 2x = 600 - 240 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 360 \\]\n\\[ x = 180 \\]\n\nSo, Derek sold 180 dogs and bought 210 more cars. The number of dogs now is:\n\\[ 90 - 180 + 210 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dogs Derek has now is 120.</think>\n<answer>\\boxed{120}</answer><|im_end|>"
